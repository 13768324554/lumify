<p>
  Lumify is an open source project to create a big data fusion, analysis, and
  visualization platform designed for anyone to use. Its intuitive web-based
  interface helps users discover connections and explore relationships in their
  data via a suite of analytic options, including 2D and 3D graph
  visualizations, full-text faceted search, dynamic histograms, interactive
  geographic maps, and collaborative workspaces shared in real-time.
</p>

<h2>Concepts</h2>
<p>
  Understanding a couple key concepts will greatly help in making sense of what
  Lumify does and how it does it.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Ontology</strong> - An ontology is the structure for organizing
    information you care to analyze in Lumify. Basically, it's your data model.
    The entities, relationships, and properties that make up Lumify's graph are
    entirely specified by you using OWL.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Entity</strong> - An entity is any "thing" you want to represent in
    Lumify. It could be a person, place, event, etc. Entities have properties
    and relationships to other entities.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Relationship</strong> - A relationship is a link between two
    entities. For example, Joe (entity) works with (relationship) Susan
    (entity). Lumify can be configured to understand and enforce valid
    relationships between entities.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Properties</strong> - Properties are data about an entity. For
    example, a person entity may have properties for first name, last name,
    date of birth, height, weight, etc. Lumify will track whatever properties
    you define in your ontology.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Graph</strong> - The data model within Lumify is stored as a graph
    of entities, or things, and the relationships between those entities. For
    the technologists out there, these are usually referred to as vertices
    (entities) and edges (relationships). Entities and relationships can have
    one or more associated properties.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
  As an open source project, Lumify features are evolving all the time. Below
  is an explanation of the primary ones.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Search</strong> - Lumify provides a full-text search over
    everything in your graph. You can also use custom filters built from
    properties defined in your ontology.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Graph Visualization</strong> - The primary feature of Lumify is the
    graph visualization. Lumify provides both 2D and 3D graph visualizations
    with a variety of automatic layouts to help you tame a crowded graph.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Link Analysis</strong> - Lumify provides a variety of options for
    analyzing the links between entities on the graph. A right click menu on
    any entity allows you to display all related entities, find paths to another
    entity, and establish a new relationship (i.e. connect) to another entity.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Geospatial Analysis</strong> - Lumify provides the ability to
    integrate any Open Layers-compatible mapping system, such as Google Maps or
    ESRI, for geospatial analysis. Any data tagged with location information
    can be aggregated and viewed on a map.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Multimedia Analysis</strong> - Data comes in all shapes and sizes.
    Out of the box, Lumify comes with specific ingest processing and interface
    elements for textual content, images, and videos.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Collaboration</strong> - Lumify's spaces feature allows you to
    organize work into a set of projects, or workspaces. Each space can be
    individually shared in read-only or edit mode with other Lumify users.
    Changes to the space are immediately propagated to everyone sharing the
    workspace without needing to refresh browser windows.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Why use Lumify?</h2>
<p>
  The challenge of making sense of the ever-increasing volumes of data isn't
  going away any time soon. The ability to effectively deal with this
  data-deluge will be a key differentiator for businesses moving forward. Eric
  Schmidt, executive chairman of Google, was recently quoted as saying that
  "the biggest disrupter (of 2014) that we're sure about is the arrival of big
  data and machine intelligence everywhere". Lumify can serve as that platform.
  It is
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Free</strong> - Lumify is completely free. There are no licensing or
    usage fees whatsoever for the software.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Permissively Licensed</strong> - All Lumify code is licensed under
    the Apache 2 license, giving you the freedom to use it commercially, modify,
    and redistribute.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Open Source</strong> - All Lumify source code is open and available.
    You can go see it right now. With that openness comes the ability to change
    and adapt it to your needs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Scalable</strong> - We didn't attempt to reinvent the wheel with
    Lumify. It's built on proven, scalable, open source big data technologies
    including Apache Hadoop and Apache Accumulo.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Secure</strong> - Lumify is built on top of Accumulo and leverages
    its cell-level security features to individually control access to entities,
    properties, and relationships.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Supported</strong> - Altamira is committed to building an open
    source big data analysis and visualization platform for its customers and
    the wider open source community. We've dedicated a full-time development
    team to making this a success.
  </li>
</ul>
