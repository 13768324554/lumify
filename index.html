  <h2>What are you doing with your data?</h2>
  <p>
  There's tremendous insight hiding in your existing data. Do you have the tools
  to discover and exploit it? We didn't, so we decided to build them.
  At <a href="http://www.altamiracorp.com">Altamira</a>, we're leading the creation
  of an open source big data integration, analytics, and visualization platform.
  Basically, it's a way to aggregate your data, organize it, and extract useful insights.
  </p>
  <p>
  We need your help and guidance! We've just released Lumify into the wild and it's
  still a young project. We're looking for people interested in kicking the tires,
  providing feedback, and helping to improve the project. If you're interested, 
  please <a href="https://github.com/altamiracorp/lumify">read the docs</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/altamiracorp/lumify">check out the source</a>.
