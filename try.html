<p>
  We're running a demo instance of Lumify at <a href="https://try.lumify.io">try.lumify.io</a>
  for you to play with at your leisure. Simply login with one of the social options
  and you're on your way. Before doing that though, please read this page for
  background information that will help you get started quickly.
</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>
  Please note that try.lumify.io is intended to help people learn about Lumify
  and should not be used for real work that one wouldn't want to lose.
  The software deployed to try.lumify.io is a development version of Lumify
  that may be updated without notice and could be unstable at times. You should
  expect any work you do on try.lumify.io to be deleted at any time without warning.
</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>
  Lumify is open source software under active development. It's still be shaped
  and tuned and almost certainly has bugs. Your feedback is the lifeblood of making
  Lumify a useful product. Please contribute your thoughts, concerns, problems,
  or anything else to our <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/lumify">Lumify mailing list</a>.
  The occasional compliment is nice too!
</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
  It would be a good idea to skim the <a href="/docs">Lumify documentation</a> and watch a few
  short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDX7b-6_sNA7SCJw5rB9EF0TDpQyrO2XR">feature videos</a>
  before diving in. Lumify can do a lot more than is immediately obvious when
  first staring at the user interface.
</p>

<h2>Demo Dataset</h2>
<p>
  A small dataset related to drug trafficking activities has been pre-loaded into
  try.lumify.io to get you started. Searching for terms like cartel, Mexico,
  or FBI will give you results you can start playing with immediately.
</p>

<h2>Upload Your Own Data</h2>
<p>
  You can upload your own office documents, images, videos, etc. simply
  by dragging them from your desktop to the Lumify workspace. Anything you upload to
  Lumify will be isolated to your workspace, so don't worry about other people
  seeing it. Please be considerate about how much data you upload.
</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
  We've attempted to make try.lumify.io as easy and painless as possible to
  quickly try out. To do that we've removed the publish privilege from all user
  accounts. The publish privilege allows local changes to a workspace to be
  published for other Lumify users to see. Therefore, everything you do on
  try.lumify.io will only be visible to you unless you explicitly share your
  workspace with another user via the workspace sharing feature.
</p>
<p>
  Please also be aware that <strong>Lumify does not work with Internet Explorer</strong>
  before version 10, and even that may be unstable. We recommend using a recent
  version of <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/chrome/browser/">Chrome</a>,
  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>, or
  <a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>.
