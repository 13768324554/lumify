Two Altamira employees working on the development of [Lumify](http://lumify.io/) recently gave presentations at a joint event co-hosted by the [DC Natural Language Processing](http://www.meetup.com/DC-NLP/events/167155162/) and [Graph Database Baltimore-Washington](http://www.meetup.com/graphdb-baltimore/events/166953802/) meetup groups. These presentations featured Lumify's use of graph database technology to enable exploration and manipulation of NLP-enriched datasets.

[Joe Ferner](https://twitter.com/joeferner), Senior Software Engineer at Altamira, described the creation of [SecureGraph](https://github.com/altamiracorp/secure-graph) and how it supports authorizations, visibility strings, multivalued properties, and property metadata as the graph database used in Lumify.

The video of Joe's talk was posted on [YouTube](http://youtu.be/JMde_jFDM2M):

Joe's slides and code samples are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/altamiracorp/secure-graph-presentation).

The crowd of about 100 NLP enthusiasts & graph database aficionados asked a ton of great questions and the technical discussions continued long after the presentations concluded. Many thanks to [Neo4j](http://www.neo4j.org/) for sponsoring the pizza & beer, and to [Segue Technologies](http://www.seguetech.com/) for providing the meeting space.
