title: "Cleaner Search Results Design for Lumify"
author: Jeff Kunkle
excerpt: The recently improved search results display is now ready for you to kick the tires. Read on to hear about what we've changed.

We recently took a look at our search results display and decided it was time
to clean things up a bit. All search results now have a fixed width icon to the
left, which is a custom thumbnail for results with uploaded images or the default
icon for the associated content type. See example below.

Previously, we only displayed thumbnails for results with user-uploaded images
and left the others as a text only display. This caused two problems:

1. The title text for all the results did not line up neatly, making things
a little visually jarring.
1. For results without an uploaded image, it was hard to tell what type of
content was represented without clicking to view it.

We think we've solved these issues with a much cleaner design, but you're the
ultimate judge. Swing by our [demo site](/try.html) to check out the new search results
view and [let us know what you think](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/lumify).
