Charlie Greenbacker, Altamira's Director of Data Science, will give a conference presentation on Lumify's geospatial capabilities at [Location Intelligence 2014](http://www.locationintelligence.net/dc/) in Washington, D.C. on May 20.

Charlie's talk, entitled **[Fusing Structured and Unstructured Data for Geospatial Insights in Lumify](http://www.locationintelligence.net/dc/presentations/fusing-structured-and-unstructured-data-for-geospatial-insights-in-lumify/386706)**, is scheduled for the 3:00pm &ndash; 4:00pm session on Analyzing Big Data in the [LocationTech](http://www.locationtech.org/) Summit track within the main conference. This presentation will demonstrate how Lumify can be used to fuse data from multiple sources into a unified knowledge base, then analyzing that knowledge to uncover hidden connections and actionable insights buried within the geospatial context.

Location Intelligence is an annual conference about location and geospatial information technology for business and enterprise IT. This year's theme is _Location Analytics and Visual Data Discovery... New Pathways to Business Intelligence_. One component of LI 2014 is the [Eclipse Foundation's](http://www.eclipse.org/) [LocationTech Working Group](http://www.locationtech.org/) Summit, which will feature tracks on open source geospatial technology.

### **Talk Description:**

_Lumify is an open source big data integration, analytics, and visualization platform designed to help users discover connections and explore relationships in their data. It can ingest anything from spreadsheets and text documents, to images and video, representing this diverse data as a collection of entities, properties, and relationships between entities. Everything is stored in a scalable and secure graph database to enable advanced social network analysis and complex graph traversals. Built on proven open source technologies for big data like Hadoop, Storm, and Accumulo, Lumify supports a variety of mission-critical use cases centered around the emerging concepts of activity-based intelligence (ABI), object-based production (OBP), and human geography (HG). Its intuitive web-based user interface provides a suite of analytic options with multiple views on the data, including 2D and 3D graphs, full-text faceted search, histograms with aggregate statistics, and an interactive geographic map exploration feature. This talk will demonstrate how Lumify can be used to fuse structured and unstructured data from multiple sources into a unified knowledge base, and then analyze that knowledge to uncover hidden connections and actionable insights buried within the data's geospatial context._
