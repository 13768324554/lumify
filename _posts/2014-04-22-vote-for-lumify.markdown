The Lumify team is hard at work spreading the word about our big data analysis & visualization platform by giving demos to dozens of potential customers and speaking at various conferences & [meetups](https://www.altamiracorp.com/blog/news/lumify-developers-give-talks-at-nlp-graph-database-meetup). The response has been overwhelmingly positive, and now we need your help to get Lumify in front of the largest audience so far. We recently submitted a proposal to give a talk about Lumify's geospatial capabilities at [FOSS4G 2014](https://2014.foss4g.org/), the largest global conference on open source geospatial software. FOSS4G typically attracts about a thousand attendees, and this year's keynote speaker will be Mike Bostock, creator of [D3.js](http://d3js.org/). FOSS4G uses a community review system to help choose which presentations to accept for the conference program. Please click the link below and follow the instructions to vote for Lumify, then ask your friends to do the same!

Once you're in the review system, you can use the entry filter or do a page search for "Lumify" to find our submission.

Please hurry - voting closes May 5th!
