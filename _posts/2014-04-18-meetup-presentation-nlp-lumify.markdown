author: Charlie Greenbacker
excerpt: Charlie Greenbacker, Altamira's Director of Data Science, recently gave a meetup presentation on how natural language processing (NLP) tools are used in Lumify to enrich the text content of ingested data and automatically discover connections.

Two Altamira employees working on the development of [Lumify](http://lumify.io/) recently gave presentations at a joint event co-hosted by the [DC Natural Language Processing](http://www.meetup.com/DC-NLP/events/167155162/) and [Graph Database Baltimore-Washington](http://www.meetup.com/graphdb-baltimore/events/166953802/) meetup groups. These presentations featured Lumify's use of graph database technology to enable exploration and manipulation of NLP-enriched datasets.

[Charlie Greenbacker](https://twitter.com/greenbacker), Altamira's Director of Data Science, provided an overview of Lumify and discussed how [natural language processing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) (NLP) tools are used to enrich the text content of ingested data and automatically discover connections with other bits of information.

The crowd of about 100 NLP enthusiasts & graph database aficionados asked a ton of great questions and the technical discussions continued long after the presentations concluded. Many thanks to [Neo4j](http://www.neo4j.org/) for sponsoring the pizza & beer, and to [Segue Technologies](http://www.seguetech.com/) for providing the meeting space.
